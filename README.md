Nelson Mandela

<p>
Nelson Mandela. Is there a need to say more? The man was a legend,a household name when you think of the civil rights movement there weren't too many ahead of him.
His victory in South Africa despite being put behind bars is spoken of greatly. He also put an end to apartheid. This is why my tribute page is dedicated to him.
